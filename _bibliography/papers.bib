  abstract = {State-of-the-art industrial IoT solutions struggle to handle applications in which timing is important and deterministic event ordering is crucial. We illustrate this on the basis of a simple parking lot occupancy sensing use case that is easy to explain but virtually impossible to implement using commercially available IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we compare an implementation using AWS IoT Core against one using Lingua Franca, a time-centric coordination language for constructing deterministic concurrent and distributed reactive software. Our preliminary evaluation shows that Lingua Franca can reliably address our use case.},
